# 🏠 Rent Price Prediction in France (Regression Project)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I am building a **machine learning regression model** to predict rental prices of real estate properties in France.  

The project is still a **work in progress** and I am exploring different approaches for:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation
